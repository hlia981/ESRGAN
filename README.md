# Super-Resolution for SOD

This repository contains implementations of various deep learning models for image super-resolution. The included models are:

## 1. Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN)
- Description: A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approach for single-image super-resolution.
- Features:
  - Enhances the resolution of low-resolution images.
  - Adversarial training for realistic output generation.

## 2. Edge-Enhanced SRGAN
- Description: An extension of SRGAN that incorporates edge information into the super-resolution process.
- Features:
  - Preserves and enhances edges in the high-resolution output.
  - Utilizes edge detection techniques.

## 3. Multi-Task SRGAN
- Description: A variant of SRGAN that simultaneously handles multiple super-resolution tasks.
- Features:
  - Generates high-resolution outputs for different scaling factors or resolutions.
  - Provides flexibility and versatility in super-resolution capabilities.

## 4. Sub-pixel CNN
- Description: A convolutional neural network utilizing sub-pixel convolutional layers.
- Features:
  - Upsamples low-resolution feature maps for higher-resolution outputs.
  - Specifically designed for image super-resolution.

Each model has its own directory within this repository, containing the necessary code, pretrained weights (if available), and detailed instructions for usage and training.
